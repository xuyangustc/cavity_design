PROJECT "Using a backbone-centered statistical energy to design diverse cavity-containing proteins"



The project will run in Linux.




Before designing cavity-containing proteins, user must:

1. extract high quality loop lib, and put all loops in folder named hqll

2. install stride to calculate secondary structure

3. install ABACUS2 to design sequence

4. install alphafold2 to predict structure

5. compail code of modified SCUBA package

6. set environment variate:
	export ABACUS_DATAPATH={CUR_DIR}/energy_data/
	CUR_DIR is current directory

User could move executable file in src/build/test/ to ~/bin/ to use it directly.



Process to compail modified SCUBA package (command lines in shell):

1. if ~/lib/ exist:
	mv lib/* ~/lib/
   else:
	mv lib ~/
   lable dir of ~ as libdir (such as "/home/username/")

2. cd code

3. change line 18 of CMakeLists.txt as "SET(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64:${libdir}/lib:$ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}")"

4. mkdir build

5. cd build

6. cmake ..

7. make

if successfully, all executable projects will be found in test/



After compiling, user can design following as run.sh.

run.sh shows how to generate proteins with 10 initial backbone. If need more protein(such as 10000), user should change 10 to 10000 in pars/par_initial_chain_gen and run.sh.

After running run.sh, user can get many decoys and can use other tools (such alphafold2) to test the quality of sequence.

Note that run.sh will run in serially, it is better to run parallel.
